# Simmit: Simple Forum 

Simmit is a simple Reddit-like forum built with **React.JS, Vite, Tailwind and Supabase**\

Currently the site is filled with example posts I copied from Reddit, but feel free to post anything you want to test out the site.\
**Note:** Email confirmation is currently disabled, so you can freely sign up to test with a temporary email account.
